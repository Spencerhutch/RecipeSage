  <p><b>A little about me</b></p>
  <p>
    I'm a software developer in southern California. I do a lot of work on open
    source code and I spend a lot of time working on small projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    RecipeSage is one of my hobbies - I work on it in my free time. I have been
    working on RecipeSage since 2017 - It's exciting to see how it has grown and
    changed over time.
  </p>

  <p><b>Why create RecipeSage?</b></p>
  <p>
    I created RecipeSage to host recipes for me and my family. After trying
    multiple recipe programs online, I felt it would be best to create a recipe
    program that worked exactly as I wanted it to.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a believer in freeware - I want RecipeSage to be free to use. Everyone
    should be able to access and use this software. Please, feel free to suggest
    new features and improvements. I want RecipeSage to grow and improve.
  </p>

    If you'd like to
    <a (click)="$event.preventDefault(); goToDonate()" href=""
      >contribute to support development</a
    >, I'd really appreciate it. It's costly to run servers and host images, and
    I'd love help! Contributing also unlocks some features for your account
    (features that are cost-prohibitive to offer for free) as a thank you.
